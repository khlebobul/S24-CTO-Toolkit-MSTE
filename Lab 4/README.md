# Portfolio web page

### Plan for creating portfolio website
- Examples of portfolio websites.
- Cloning template.
- Code practice.
- Vercel deployment (optional).

### Development plan
- Creating the structure of a portfolio web page.
- Applying styles to make the site look aesthetically pleasing.
- Adding interactive elements using JavaScript.
- Uploading and deploying the site on the hosting.

#### How to make your website looks more attractive with JS
- Parallax effects: Add parallax effects to create an impression of depth and dynamism on your page. This can be done using libraries such as Parallax.js.
- Effects on background images: Add effects on background images such as blurring, animated backgrounds or video backgrounds.
- Animated titles and texts: Use animation libraries such as Anime.js or GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) to create animated titles, texts, and other elements.
- Mouse or touchscreen interaction: Add interactive effects that respond to mouse movements or taps on touchscreen devices. This could be, for example, parallax effects or mouseover animations.
- Image slider or carousel: Add a slider to scroll through your portfolio images. You can use libraries like Swiper.js or Slick to implement this.
- Scroll animations (scroll animations): Add animations of elements as you scroll the page. This can be elements appearing, disappearing, changing size or color. A library such as ScrollMagic can be useful in this case.
- Filtering and sorting of work: Implement functionality to filter and sort your portfolio into different categories or parameters. This can be done using JavaScript and CSS classes.
- Modal windows (modal windows): Add modal windows to display more details about your work or to view it full size.
